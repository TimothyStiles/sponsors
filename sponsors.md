:wave: Hello fellow Homo Sapiensm:walking:! 

I'm Tim. I'm creating [_Poly_](https://github.com/TimothyStiles/poly). The world's greatest library and command line utility for engineering organisms.

My mission is to make biotech developers :dna: :computer: (including myself) as productive as possible. It's what drives me to do what I do and it's why I make it open source.

By sponsoring me and my projects you're building a better biofuture. You'll also get a ton of great perks to help you and your company. Check them out on the right over there in the sidebar :arrow_forward: and choose your tier.


:metal: Thanks for the :dollar: :euro: :yen: :pound: and hack on my peeps! :metal: 

Tim
