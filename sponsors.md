Hi! I'm Tim!  I'm creating [_Poly_](https://github.com/TimothyStiles/poly). The world's greatest library and command line utility for engineering organisms.

My mission is to make biotech developers :dna: :computer: (including myself) as productive as possible. It's what drives me to do what I do and it's why I make it open source.

🙏If you use Poly, or any of my other projects, a monthly contribution would mean A WHOLE LOT. On its own, open-source doesn't pay the bills. Hopefully, with your help, continuing my work can be sustainable, and I won't have to go get a real job 😛.


:metal: Thanks for reading and hack on my peeps! :metal: 

Tim
