:wave: Hello fellow Homo Sapiens :walking:! 

I'm Tim and I'm creating _Poly_. The world's greatest library and command line utility for engineering organisms.

My mission is to make biotech developers :dna: :computer: (including myself) as productive as possible. It's what drives me to do what I do and it's why I make it open source.

By sponsoring me and my projects you're building a better biofuture. You'll also get a ton of great perks for you and your company. Check them out on the right over there in the sidebar and choose your tier. :arrow_forward::arrow_forward::arrow_forward:

:metal: Thanks for the :dollar: :euro: :yen: :pound: and hack on my peeps! :metal: 

Tim
